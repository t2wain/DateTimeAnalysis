## User usage pattern

Often, a larger number of users can share a smaller number of licenses adequately since users will use the software at different times of the day, especially if users are located at various locations globally in different time zones. Factors that affects the availability of licenses are follow.

- The ratio of number of users vs. number of licenses. This ratio can fluctuate over time as company workloads varied.
- Some users are much more active than others.
- There are more users at certain locations than at other locations.

A set of usage statistics can be calculated for each user that can be used to identify usage trends over time and such data can be used as basis for deciding when additional licenses are required.
